<h3>Why Learn Node.js?</h3>

<p>
    JavaScript is the most-used language on GitHub, and it’s ranked highly by
    developers. Companies including Netflix, Uber, Trello, PayPal, LinkedIn,
    eBay, NASA and Medium have adopted Node.js, and most professional
    developers will have encountered Node.js tools.
</p>
<p>
    Below, we’ll look at some of the reasons you should consider using Node.js.
<p>

<h3>It’s JavaScript</h3>
<p>

JavaScript is used on trillions of web pages, where it has a browser
monopoly. Every professional web developer requires JavaScript knowledge
to program client-side applications.
</p>
<p>
Server-side languages are more diverse. Historically, developers could opt for
PHP, Ruby, Python, C# (ASP.NET), Perl, or Java, but these have different
syntaxes and concepts. It can be difficult to switch contexts, so larger project
teams often split into frontend and backend developers.Node.js allows a developer with frontend JavaScript knowledge to leverage
their skills on the backend. It won’t make you a full-stack developer
overnight, but the concepts are similar, and there’s less rigmarole when
formatting JSON, handling character sets, using WebSockets, and so on.
</p>

<h3>It’s Fast</h3>

<p>
    Most server-side languages are fast enough, but few match the speed of
    Node.js. The V8 engine is quick, and it evolves rapidly, having the weight of
    Google and Chrome behind its development. Node.js also has a non-
    blocking, event-driven I/O.
